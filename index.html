            <p>
                <img src="./assets/images/emo.jpg" alt="Profile Photo" class="profImg"> Fan of sleep, ramen eater, tattoo addict, and not a public speaker. Making at the nexus of beauty and purpose
                to answer design problems with honest solutions. I work well in any situation except when I'm tired. Which
                is always.
            </p>

            <p>
                As of 2018 I am importing Magic 8-Balls in Mexico. Was quite successful at writing about Yu-Gi-Oh back in the day. Had moderate
                success developing mixed drink concoctions in my early adulthood. Have some experience getting my feet wet
                with love in San Diego, CA. Spent the 90's training ants in natural disaster handling. Have a strong interest
                in supervising the production of hot air balloons in Orlando, FL.
            </p>

            <p>
                I once spent several months doing absolutely nothing. Once gave a speech about tooth brushing. Won several honorable mentions
                in art competitions. Spent 2001-2008 playing World of Warcraft. Was quite successful at spending all my money
                on beer. Spent a weekend pretending I was cool.
